Configuration to the GIT
=> Why?
If you want git to track the changes you are making to a file(s) in a specific folder, then we need to configure git.
=> What?
We have to configure, email id and name in the git
=> Ways to configure?
There are 3 ways to configure git;
	- System level
	- Global level	- Preferred
	- Local level
=> How to do the configuration?
	- Create a folder
	- Open gitbash terminal
	- Configure username 
	- Configure email id

git config --global user.name <UserName>
git config --global user.email <EMail-ID>

To verify the username and email;
git config user.name
git config user.email

To see the list of all configurations
git config --list

To unset the username and email
git config --global --unset user.name
git config --global --unset user.email

Note: Git configuration is a time activity.
Note: All git commands will start with "git"

=> Stages in Git
3 different stages are available in git.
	- Working directory
	- Staging area
	- Repository area

=> How does Git function? Git Workflow

=> Types of git commands
	1. High-level commands	- used frequently
	2. Porcelain commands	- less frequently / based on requirement

=> Working with git commands
	- Create a folder
	- Open gitbash terminal
	- Initialize git
	- Create a file
	- Add the file to the staging area
	- Add the file to the repository area

=> To see the commit history
	- git log
	- git log --oneline

=> git show
=> git help -a
=> git help <CommandName>

To add all the files to the staging area
git add . 

To add specific files to the staging area
git add <FileNames>

To commit a specific file
git commit -m "<CommitMessage>" <FileNames>

To see the commit history
git log

To see the latest 2 commits
git log -2
git log --oneline -2

To see the commit history from oldest to latest
git log --reverse
git log --reverse --oneline

To see the commit history of a specific file
git log <FileName>

To see only the commit messages and to know number of commits made
git shortlog

To see the statistics of commits
git log --stat
git log -p
git log -p -2

To see only the number of commits made in a specific branch
git rev-list --count HEAD

To see the number of commits made in all the branches
git rev-list --count --all

Note: It is not recommended to delete the ".git" folder. If we delete, the configurations available in the .git folder will also be deleted. If the configurations are deleted, we cannot push the files from local repo to remote repo (GitHub)

GIT BLAME
To know the author name and author email of a line in a file whoever has commited

To display the author names who has changed the lines
git blame <FileName> 

To display the author email ids who has changed the lines
git blame -e <FileName>

To unstage a staged file
git rm --cached <FileName>

How to recover a deleted file?
	Create a file and add it and commit it
	Write some content inside the same file and add it and commit it
	Delete the file
	Get the logs of a file
	Recover the file
		git checkout <NextLatestCommitID> <FileName>
	Verify for the recovered file and its content

GIT DIFF
To see the differences b/w any two commits
It is also used to see the changes b/w working tree and staging area

GIT CHECKOUT
To switch to the oldest version of the same file from the latest file and vice versa
Method 1 - Roll Back

Method 2 - Recover a deleted file

GIT RESTORE
Method 3 - Restoring to the original version of a file

Method 4 - Restore a deleted file

GIT STASH
10.00 AM ---- Manager gave you a task ---- 10.30 AM started working on the task ---- Workinggggg ----- 01.00 PM ---- Manager gave you another task which is of immediate priority

10.30 AM --- Still going on (70% completed) - Will you add and commit? NOOOOO
Git offers to store the partially completed work in a temporary location
And then you can start working on the new task
